Until now the design , styles and setting up the frameworks and builders and fine .

We should do the JavaScript one : 
* The storage using JSON
* every button and its functionnalities 
* Think about a pop-up that appears while creating the project  : design it before the implementation on JavaScript
* Other JS classses that are important
